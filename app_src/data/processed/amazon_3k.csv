1,"If you want your kid to end up on welfare read them this book...: The message in this book is reflective of the overall tone of American society these days: ""Don't have ambition or push yourself, simply settle for what makes you comfortable and you'll be happy."" The book blatantly puts a negative spin on the characters in the book that are striving to push themselves outside of their comfort zone and grow in some fashion. I know some of you are thinking ""hey man, it's a kids book, lighten up"", but you know as well as I that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up. Imagine an entire generation of people who refused to push themselves because it was too hard or too uncomfortable. This nation rose to the top for the very reason that people pushed themselves and took risks that were uncomfortable. My recommendation: if you see this book, burn it.",if you want your kid to end up on welfare read them this book the message in this book is reflective of the overall tone of american society these days don t have ambition or push yourself simply settle for what makes you comfortable and you ll be happy the book blatantly puts a negative spin on the characters in the book that are striving to push themselves outside of their comfort zone and grow in some fashion i know some of you are thinking hey man it s a kids book lighten up but you know as well as i that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up imagine an entire generation of people who refused to push themselves because it was too hard or too uncomfortable this nation rose to the top for the very reason that people pushed themselves and took risks that were uncomfortable my recommendation if you see this book burn it,1

Not many of my friends have seen this movie, basically because it is a classic. I like classic movies. The DVD quality is great. The picture is very sharp and the sound is pretty well done in 5.1 surround. This movie is awesome! Get it! I warn you the MGM edition has a booklet that contains a main menu shot of more bonus footage, but my copy doesn't have the features. My DVD is a ""flipper disc"" though.

My 2-star rating is NOT for the film itself.The question here is product QUALITY.I've been checking out various offerings from this gray market dealer. Seems reviewers give their movies either 5 star or 1 star ratings. While one will laud their superior transfer quality the next absolutely trashes it as THE WORST. Very contradictory. VERY confusing! Also, I've seen a single new reviewer who's posted 5 reviews, four of which are five-star BIG D ones.

The episode ""Angel"" introduces us to that romance and it's a great way for newcomers to the series to catch up. ""The Puppet Show"" is creepy but also a real riot.

The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away.

2,"A portrait of a father: Richard Brookhiser's ""Founding Father"" is an interesting book. Instead of being a straightforward biography, it seeks to extract the moral lessons from President Washington's life. This technique bears much fruit for thought. Particularly, I was struck by Brookhiser's focus on George Washington as the father of our country and how it speaks to us today-in an age of broken and nonfunctioning families. There are many good lessons to learn from Washington's life in this book. The one thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is Brookhiser's tendency to slant how he thinks Washington would deal with modern issues (public education for example) in a way that makes them very like Brookhiser's views. However, this happens only a few times and as it is obvious when he is doing so, does not warrant too much concern.

1,"A far cry from her usual level of entertainment...: If this is what Otto Penzsler feels is ""non-stop action,"" I'm going to have to pay less attention to his reviews. I agree with Amazon's review, which refers to the ""plodding pace."" I could barely finish this book, and wouldn't have if it weren't Sue Grafton. The plot was so thin I figured it out immediately, and it was so easy to see through Mariah that I couldn't believe Grafton had the nerve to make it so obvious. I have greatly enjoyed all the books in the series up until now, but in my opinion, this is by far the worst. Very difficult to care about any of the colorless characters, and I found it hard to like even Kinsey in this book. If this were Grafton's first novel in the series it would go nowhere.

There is absolutely no justification for this movie to be so long since it hardly touches the complexities of its source.

Then again I don't understand all the fuss around ""Gone With the Wind"" either.The performances by Shariff and Christie were amazing. By that I mean that it appeared that they were filmed separately performing their roles, then the results were edited together.

I particularly liked the way Ms Woods demonstrated each technique on paper rather than describing it, all the time showing the model, and at times even superimposing her drawing over the model to make a point.

If this exact book had been written by someone with less potential, I'd probably have enjoyed it more -- but I bought it being familiar with Stross' track record on his later novels, and was expecting more than I got.The book's biggest flaw, besides an incomprehensible political situation with warring clans of merchants, is that so much of the story comes from exposition. Rather than having his characters really experience the world, and the story being shown rather than told, the characters spout huge blocks of expository dialogue, so they end up telling you more than showing you.I'd say stay away from this one.

Other than that Jordan gives the characters old and new more depth and life. So far I have been quite pleased with the series as it becomes more interesting with each book.

I keep reading, waiting for something to happen and I have so far beenr disappointed (and I am nearly finished).

As for me, I eat that stuff up, so it made it easier for me to enjoy the real meat of the film.People who can't handle a light hearted movie with a few catch phrases belittle this film, but it has a lot going for it. The acting is pretty good- George Carlin is terrific, and Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves do quite well (even though they didn't truly nail their characters until Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey). The Time Lore presented here is, actually, quite thought provoking. Really think about what's being manipulated here, and to what degree it is or is not feasible given generally accepted time mechanics.

However least I be too forgiving, I must say that none of the 25th performers are up to Phillip Quast or Ruthie Henshall (this comment made me go to You-Tube and listen to Ruthie sing ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" and Phillip sing ""Stars before finishing this review).

I keep whacking the pots and pans against the faucet as I rinse them because there is little clearance. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to wash large pots and pans if my sink wasn't 12"" deep which really helps.

This new direction is indeed an improvement from their other work. The songs have become more powerful, and more potent. Look back at Ten and you have great technical guitar playing, towering vocals, and pulsing bass lines. They have actually risen above that, and have been able to add more atmosphere and mood to the emotion often displayed on their previous albums.

I am sick of hollywood giving us the same three people in every comedy.

The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship.

The way Jamie writes, and even the way he uses approximate measures, like a ""handful of basil"", encourages the home cook to have more confidence, imagination and fun in the kitchen.

2,"A Pretty Good Adaption of the Book: While The Rules of Attraction is definitely not for everyone, I loved it and I'm sure that plenty of other people will love it too. Straying only slightly from the Bret Easton Ellis novel, the movie was able to capture the same feel as the book. I also enjoyed the great acting, creative cinematography, and excellent music.

The story creates a suprising ending. It is a great short story for someone looking for a short and good read. I recommend this to everyone.

2,"Reverb is King: Reverb is king in this DVD. I went through a period where I thought I didn't need classical guitar in my life. For some unknown reason, I sold this DVD back to Amazon. I'm not sure why I did this - I loved Andre Segovia during his final years as a musician. This Dvd recounts his final days and beautifully shows how well the classical guitar sounds in his arms. The best part about this DVD is the effect of reverb on each guitar solo. Segovia plays in a hall (Alhambra I suppose?) and was able to produce the most spetacular sound in each recording. I own a Korg effects box, and I couldn't even reproduce the tone this man produced. If I were to record a good classical guitar CD, the sound from this dvd would be the sound I'd want to capture.There is an interview, as well. Mr. Segovia speaks English very well. He's a smart guy and I wish there were more guitarist like him on Earth. Unfortunately, he is gone, but this DVD lives on.

I recently worked overtime on a Flash website, and at the end of the deadline my hand was so cramped it was painful to extend my first finger.Aside from the less than optimal mouse shape, the biggest problem is the scroll dot. The more use your mouse gets, the more likely it is to stick so you can't scroll at all. You can unstick it by holding the mouse upside down and vigorously rolling the ball in all directions.

After she is violated she decides to ""take control"" of her life and get a new job and a new outlook on life. Unfortunately, her taking control causes more trouble and she finds herself in another situation that leads to nowhere good. Even though Trudy leads a depressing life, Monroe makes it a very engaging story. I think a lot of women can identify with Trudy at one time in their lives or another.

The series follows the heroine of the story, the first female police inspector to run a homicide unit, on the one hand contending with an overtly hostile ""old boys club"" , an idiot self centered live-in boyfriend, an unsupportive boss and a baby faced, likable serial killer.........and to add to her troubles she's got a tiny little drinking problem on the scale of ""Godzilla has foot odor"", all done in an understated, stiff upper lip, wry British humor style. A must have for any video collection.

Well written, well acted, and not a trace of sex or 4 letter words, even the battle scenes are done as tastefully as possible.

2,"Lew Archer in his prime: In some ways The Doomsters is a typical Lew Archer thriller: it involves a missing suspected murderer, family strife, and mysterious deaths in the distant past. This time, Archer falls in love and self-interest actually hinders him from being the moral center of the novel. What keeps the pace of the novel flowing is the theme of a man condemned by society and Archer's efforts to prove his innocence. There is also plenty of bloodshed, betrayals, and enough plot twists to keep the conclusion a surprise. In spite of the tragic turn the story takes there is the redemption for Archer who makes up for his own dreadful mistake in the past. It explains a great deal about Archer, his motivation and his maturity which grows in later Ross Macdonald novels.",lew archer in his prime in some ways the doomsters is a typical lew archer thriller it involves a missing suspected murderer family strife and mysterious deaths in the distant past this time archer falls in love and self interest actually hinders him from being the moral center of the novel what keeps the pace of the novel flowing is the theme of a man condemned by society and archer s efforts to prove his innocence there is also plenty of bloodshed betrayals and enough plot twists to keep the conclusion a surprise in spite of the tragic turn the story takes there is the redemption for archer who makes up for his own dreadful mistake in the past it explains a great deal about archer his motivation and his maturity which grows in later ross macdonald novels,2

It tells the story of a rather fascinating human monster, but gives the reader no real understanding or empathy for any of its characters. The voices of the book are too removed, too cold. The countess tormented and killed her hundreds of young women with no interest in the reality of their lives and interests; the book chronicles the killings in the same manner, and thus fails to involve the reader. Even the parallel plot line of the modern-day Drake, drawn into the mystical world of immortal evil, fails to involve the reader closely.

1,"Nelly lost her way with this one: I did not even bother buying this album after I heard Promiscuous on the radio. While it's a great album to dance to, and other songs on it, like Maneater and Say It Right, are infectious, this album was a disappointment to me. I was so excited when I heard that Nelly's third album was coming out, but what a let down when it finally was released! It sounds just like the garbage every other female pop vocalist is putting out. I own and love BOTH of Nelly's previous CDs because they are ORIGINAL, quirky and down-to-earth. I feel like with this third album we're seeing a trumped up, glossed over version of Nelly: so fake and completely without personality. I sincerely hope that when she puts out her fourth album she returns to her roots and stops trying to win a popularity contest. By doing so she has lost all originality.",nelly lost her way with this one i did not even bother buying this album after i heard promiscuous on the radio while it s a great album to dance to and other songs on it like maneater and say it right are infectious this album was a disappointment to me i was so excited when i heard that nelly s third album was coming out but what a let down when it finally was released it sounds just like the garbage every other female pop vocalist is putting out i own and love both of nelly s previous cds because they are original quirky and down to earth i feel like with this third album we re seeing a trumped up glossed over version of nelly so fake and completely without personality i sincerely hope that when she puts out her fourth album she returns to her roots and stops trying to win a popularity contest by doing so she has lost all originality,1

A three disc special edition for this slop? Who are they kidding? Do they think this is The Battle of Algiers?The sad fact is that while the quality of world filmmaking continues to increase, Hollywood films continue to get worse and worse, stifled by corporate and union bureaucracies and a total lack of original thought. Million Dollar Baby was not even one of the ten best films of 2004, but it earned the best pic prize because the Oscars are not so much a measure of artistic merit as they are a shameless self-promotion vehicle.

Fogerty checks in briefly with two terrific songs--the country opener Lookin' For A Reason and Someday Never Comes. Sweet Hitchhiker, despite a roaring guitar riff and a great Fogerty vocal, is CCR by the numbers. Stu Cook and Doug Clifford contribute some interesting numbers but they lack the focus and power of Fogerty's weakest material much less his strongest. Most of the originals sound like second hand garage rock knock offs of popular songs.The reality was this; CCR had returned to The Golliwogs. For the first time in their history CCR sounded like a pale imitation of themselves and half a dozen other bands.

My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion.

1,": What separates this band from Evanescence (besides geography-these guys are from Slovenia) is mainly the structural song arrangements, the inclusion of a violin, and a few industrial/progressive/gothic parts. Otherwise, you'd swear this is Evanescence's experimental follow-up album. But in the end this is Melodic Hard Rock with many catchy hooks/choruses and songs that could easily be played on the radio. The role of the violin here is just as vital as the role of a guitar, dominating throughout the record and enhancing the music. Without it, this record would probably be extremely unoriginal. Basic, yet energetic female vocals keep the flow of the music listenable. There are some brilliant musical passages like in the song ""Shut Up"" (1:46-2:14), as well as silly male verbal chants (like on ""Blah Blah"" 2:56-3:10), but overall the harmlessness and accessibility of the material is enough to satisfy the open-minded ear.",what separates this band from evanescence besides geography these guys are from slovenia is mainly the structural song arrangements the inclusion of a violin and a few industrial progressive gothic parts otherwise you d swear this is evanescence s experimental follow up album but in the end this is melodic hard rock with many catchy hooks choruses and songs that could easily be played on the radio the role of the violin here is just as vital as the role of a guitar dominating throughout the record and enhancing the music without it this record would probably be extremely unoriginal basic yet energetic female vocals keep the flow of the music listenable there are some brilliant musical passages like in the song shut up 1 46 2 14 as well as silly male verbal chants like on blah blah 2 56 3 10 but overall the harmlessness and accessibility of the material is enough to satisfy the open minded ear,1

The title song performed by Garbage is really cool; I like it better than most other Bond titles. Songs like ""Ice Chase"" and ""Caviar Factory"" are inspired, weaving the classic Dr No melody or the TWINE theme song into some pounding action music. The one problem is that many of the songs are either slow seemingly without much to them. However, tracks 2, 3, 8, 10, and 14, as well as some others, more than make up for that.

1,"Underwhelmed: I bought this book to keep my son, who just finished fourth grade, interested in math and to allow him to maintain progress starting from what he had learned over the previous year. The book promised fun problems that would not take long to complete.The problems in the book were essentially the same type of exercises as my son had been assigned in school over the prior two years, by which he had been bored.

Or you'll select a cup size and a fraction of that amount will dispense. Workarounds include turning the machine on and off, lifting the handle up and back down, lifting off the water reservoir and putting it back on.

1,"The death of literature: With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading ""great literature"" over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be.

1,"Boring, Pathetic and Sad.: I read every page of this boring book as it was on my high school daughter's suggested summer reading list. On page 136 Taylor Greer makes one true understatement when she says, ""I know I'm ignorant."" This story is pathetic in that when she is given the Cherokee Indian child and takes her to a motel, she sees plainly that the child has been sexually abused, yet she doesn't take the child to a doctor for several months. He then shows her x-rays where the child has had multiple fractures from abuse. The book has no wisdom, except for the proper English spoken by the Mayan teacher and what does Taylor do, but thinks she's in love with him, when his wife is along with him. This was just sad. This Kentucky hillbilly character is sarcastic and rude, and too lazy to get a starter in her car, so she doesn't have to push it.

1,"Come on man!!!!: It never ceases to amaze me on how fans of Miles Davis (few) claim to really enjoy this piece of garbage! Truthfully, I don't even know why this album in particular was reissued. The first track ""One Phone Call/Street Scenes"", the crappiest track on the album re-caps from when he was arrested by the police while driving his Ferrari. Sting makes an unnecessary appearance on the track posing as a French cop (gag). ""Time After Time"", and ""Human Nature"" are the only songs worth listening to out of the rest. I'm not so sure what a genius like Miles Davis was thinking when he put this one out, but this was a big let down. It does, however, feature some great musicians i.e. John Scofield, Darryl Jones, etc. If you're interested in 80's Miles, start with Tutu.

It should be read by anyone familiar with the usual condemnations of the government's and individuals' actions for an eye-opening alternative point of view. It appears that the other nineteen chapters, each describing a different battle, are much more sympathetic to the Indians.

Lewis with them everywhere they go (and who wouldn't), but I particularly enjoy having these signature classics all together in one tome. It greatly facilitates flipping around to other selections for reference. I'm not going to review the individual works, because I think if a person is considering buying this collection they already know their Lewis pretty well. I have to mention the Screwtape Letters, though. What a wonderful work of allegory and fiction, and though it is fiction it is certainly not out of place in a collection of apologist writings and social commentary. Also deserving particular notice is The Abolition of Man, proving that Eastern philosophy and Christian ideology are not mutually exclusive.

1,"paternalism w/o character development: The music was good. The people seemed real but skin-deep: booze, drugs, guns, stupidity, self-destructive violence and instant sex. There's no depth to any of the characters. The question remains how can you make a movie with Chess treating his artists like children financially (read"" PATERNALLY), but the movie doesn't make clear if he is scamming them or not. Muddy Waters doesn't seem to have a clue what money is his and how much and why. Chess buys him a car as if he's an empty-headed girlfriend, and as such gets paid with whatever Chess decides to give him. Etta James decides he ""loved her"" because he left her the deed (doesnt say mortgage is paid off) of a house that cost in 1970 (year Chess died) about $35,000. Chess sold his company for over $6,000,000, and that doesnt count the millions he made on the way up. In short, they had an opportunity to make a complex character, and instead make a superficial and (almost boring) one.",paternalism w o character development the music was good the people seemed real but skin deep booze drugs guns stupidity self destructive violence and instant sex there s no depth to any of the characters the question remains how can you make a movie with chess treating his artists like children financially read paternally but the movie doesn t make clear if he is scamming them or not muddy waters doesn t seem to have a clue what money is his and how much and why chess buys him a car as if he s an empty headed girlfriend and as such gets paid with whatever chess decides to give him etta james decides he loved her because he left her the deed doesnt say mortgage is paid off of a house that cost in 1970 year chess died about 35 000 chess sold his company for over 6 000 000 and that doesnt count the millions he made on the way up in short they had an opportunity to make a complex character and instead make a superficial and almost boring one,1

My Class ""A"" tube amp's only output 22Wattts per channel necessitating a very efficient speaker system. In my research I stumbled upon the Acoustech HT-75. They were certainly efficient enough and the reviews were good, so I thought, for the price, I'd try them. Boy, was I shocked. These speakers are terrific. The low and mid frequency reproduction is superior while the high frequency is very extended with a little edge. I'm comparing these unit's to speakers that cost at least 10 times more.

At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a ""real team""; b) encouraging CEOs to create ""real"" executive ""teams"" and c) permitting ""undisciplined"" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior.

The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character.

1,"I can only agree with the previous reviewer.: As a person who has played roleplaying games for several years, I can assure everyone that there is nobody less suicidal than me. Pat Pulling, though understandably grief-ridden at the suicide of her son, has taken her grief to far, and is using D&D as a scapegoat. If her son had played tennis before he killed himself she may well have ended up making some daft theory about tennis. Sadly, since D&D is something of a fringe hobby (although the roleplaying hobby is growing all the time) many people were fooled by her and her Fundamentalist cohorts.",i can only agree with the previous reviewer as a person who has played roleplaying games for several years i can assure everyone that there is nobody less suicidal than me pat pulling though understandably grief ridden at the suicide of her son has taken her grief to far and is using d d as a scapegoat if her son had played tennis before he killed himself she may well have ended up making some daft theory about tennis sadly since d d is something of a fringe hobby although the roleplaying hobby is growing all the time many people were fooled by her and her fundamentalist cohorts,1

2,"The ""Lisa"" Spenser mentioned in SMALL VICES is explained: As with SMALL VICES, this is edgier than the old TV series and Lifetime movies, stays fairly true to the book, has iffy casting choices (they're on their fourth Belson), and was filmed in Canada rather than anywhere near Massachusetts. They didn't even bother to get any Boston PD paraphenelia when Quirk and Belson make their appearances. I first saw this shortly after seeing WITCHBLADE, so I felt that Yancy Butler didn't really fit as Lisa, since the role is a lot weaker and passive than anything else I've seen Yancy do in the past.

1,"Religious Absolutism: The whole theory behind this book is flawed. I think what Berman is talking about is one small part of a whole phenomenon that has manifested itself increasingly in the last few years, namely the phenomenon of religious Absolutism(i.e. Religious Fundamentalism). It exists increasingly in all major religions, i.e. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Jewish religions. Actually the so called war against terrorism is basically a war between manifestations of that absolutism in the U.S., The Arab/Muslim world, and Israel. The major problem, that we are facing is that Islamic religious absolutism, is a great recruitment for christian, jewish, and Hindu religious absolutism, and vice versa. Good and evil, Black and White, us and them, believers and non believers, chosen and non chosen people, are the common language used to express religious absolutism. If liberals and religious pragmatists cannot change this vocabulary, than we are in for some crazy times in this world.",religious absolutism the whole theory behind this book is flawed i think what berman is talking about is one small part of a whole phenomenon that has manifested itself increasingly in the last few years namely the phenomenon of religious absolutism i e religious fundamentalism it exists increasingly in all major religions i e christianity islam hinduism and jewish religions actually the so called war against terrorism is basically a war between manifestations of that absolutism in the u s the arab muslim world and israel the major problem that we are facing is that islamic religious absolutism is a great recruitment for christian jewish and hindu religious absolutism and vice versa good and evil black and white us and them believers and non believers chosen and non chosen people are the common language used to express religious absolutism if liberals and religious pragmatists cannot change this vocabulary than we are in for some crazy times in this world,1

1,"Dirty Shame: I'll admit that I ended up renting ""Dirty Love"" out of desperation. I like Jenny McCarthy, but something about the movie seemed like it might be trying too hard. And as it turns out, that's exactly why I'm not recommending this movie.McCarthy stars as Rebecca, a woman who was recently cheated on by her supermodel boyfriend. She proceeds to have a very public but not very funny nervous breakdown. She enlists the aid of some friends, headed up by Carmen Electra in a borderline offensive role, and Eddie Kaye Thomas of American Pie fame, who is very good in spite of his surroundings. He pines for Rebecca, but she only sees him as a friend. How original.The fact that the plot is very thin would be forgivable if there were some good laughs. I couldn't even muster a chuckle.

Their slured speech and stupidness is a key to this thilling novella.

2,"Their most accessible album: After the noise fury and hedonistic characters introduced in their first two albums, Lou Reed & Co. take a wide left turn on this graceful classic. This is an album of fantastic breadth with some of Reed's finest writing ever. The quiet beauty that surrounds songs like ""I'm Set Free"" shows that the Velvet Underground could perform just about any type of song. The rhythm-guitar on ""What Goes On"" is simply awesome. ""Beginning to See the Light"" is joyous. Other tunes demonstrate the group's vulnerability. The bookend songs, ""Candy Says"" and ""Afterhours"" are heart-breaking. ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and ""Jesus,"" perhaps the best songs on the album, are soul-wrenching.

Stone is no exception, and with THE DOORS, he makes an unfortunate foray into feature length hijinks.Don't get me wrong...the film does have some funny moments. The scene where Kilmer follows Pamela Courson home and hangs out in the window is a classic. Pamela sees him and asks why he followed her, and with impeccable comic touch, Kilmer says ""Because you're the one.""

The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf?

Contrary to other reviews, I have also paired these with a device that does not allow you to add a passkey code. Battery life is excellent, even after years of use.

All the characters are cardboard with the possible exception of Pliny, but Pliny's views as expressed here on sexuality do not seem bona fide.

Since when is it 'classic' to take what others have done and call it your own?

But the worst betrayal is the portrayal of Penelope's love affair with Richard, especially the change to its ending and to the ending of the book.

I prefer the opera recordings, but these later recordings sport surprisingly agreeable sound.

The only thing good about this drive in my view is the backup software that comes with it.

Then prepare for a frenzied round of battle! After the round, you do it all over again! I'm not sure when or how you win, but you just do. Even though it sounds simple, it's quite entertaining.

In all of his films - and even his lone dip into tv, 'Miami Vice,' - Mann successfully captures that feeling of the routine, of driving home after a long workday, of sitting down to dinner with the kids. It is that realism sprinkled over every frame of this movie that makes it so enthralling. There is no Hollywood-ending here. In 'The Insider,' words and actions have consequences, sometimes dire. Marriages dissolve. Lawsuits are filed. Jobs are lost. (you get the picture). All of that adds to the depth of our protagonist, Mr. Gladiator himself Russell Crowe, whose intensity in this film is palpable.

2,"FLYBOYS SOARS! Blu ray review.: Inspired by the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, it tells the tale of America's first fighter pilots during WWI. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece.

It is less useful in describing the larger, older, ""mainline"" denominations which these protest denominations regard as ""liberal.""

1,"Thank God its over: Finally, the Dante project of Edgar Froese has come to an end. Paradiso is the final set of disks to this project and I would not call it a Tangerine Dream album. It is an Edgar Froese album, pure and simple. Jerome is not on the disk and he is SORELY missing. This album lasts an eternity and rarely has any spark, fire, or energetic emotion. I can see why Jerome wanted no part to this debacle. He did not appear at any of the performances of Paradiso.There are a couple of good tracks on Paradiso but the incredible lenghth of this album (2+ hours!) will mean that it hardly ever gets listened to.The synths that are so characteristic of Tangerine Dream are virtually absent as there is an orchestra that are the main performers.

I won't recount the plot since other reviewers have already but the book was never boring for me and I read it an afternoon. Alison is a great character and Liz Ireland wrote it so you do root for Alison and want the best for her in the end. Liz Ireland also does a great job of creating characters so you know who to root for and for who not to root for. The title does make you think of something different than what the book actually is but the phrase ""How I stole her husband"" does tie in with what happened to Alison in the book-you'll just have to read it to find out how. I would definitely recommend this book to any chick-lit reader.

2,"Watch by Moonlight: This was a very good book, while not excellent. The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' ""The Highwayman"" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like ""The Highwayman"" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like ""Watch by Moonlight"".

Most of chapter two consists of cut-and-pasted bulleted lists each one defining a zillion terms w/o justification. So, we don't say 'acquired', we say 'captured'. Great! Can you say 'pedantic', boys and girls?Bottom line is that when an author keeps using big obfuscated words for no good reason where simpler ones would do (e.g. 'facilitate' v/s 'ease') you know you are in trouble.

On the positive side is his irreproachabe sincerity: C.S. Lewis is one of the few men who give Christians a GOOD name.

I challenge you to name another musical with the same attributes.However, for me, the real sell in this video comes in the performances of Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman. In relating a story, Friedman is a most convincing narrator because of her remarkable facial expressions. She makes the story seem new and fresh with each viewing. Granted, she may not be the most gifted vocalist in the musical market, but I would rather be moved by the authenticity of the storytelling. Donny Osmond is perfectly cast as the youthful, naive and honest Joseph.This video is taking a beating from some, and getting raves from others. I belong to the latter group and would recommend this to anyone.",mariafriedman donny osmond superb casting this edition of joseph achieves exactly what it sets out to do it was designed as a musical with broad appeal with something for everyone lloyd webber and rice succeeded at several different styles of music in this musical country pop disco 60 s rock calypso i challenge you to name another musical with the same attributes however for me the real sell in this video comes in the performances of donny osmond and maria friedman in relating a story friedman is a most convincing narrator because of her remarkable facial expressions she makes the story seem new and fresh with each viewing granted she may not be the most gifted vocalist in the musical market but i would rather be moved by the authenticity of the storytelling donny osmond is perfectly cast as the youthful naive and honest joseph this video is taking a beating from some and getting raves from others i belong to the latter group and would recommend this to anyone,2

You don't have to keep trying to impress me...or each other...or yourselves...This album encapsulates the fatal flaw of jazz music, the element that is relegating it to the dustbin of history: form over substance. Nobody will care about the technical achievements of these guys in 100 years (not many do now except those who confuse self-obsession with depth). There are moments, especially the middle section, where Coltrane and co. hint at some melodic structure, some level of aesthetic appeal, but inevitably a stylized flourish ruins everything. I suppose it's good that someone pushed the 'repetitive droning and squawking' envelope, but do you really want to listen to him do it?Art reaches out, speaks to the universal, appeals to the heart.

There are shots straight out of the book on the screen.It helps to be a fan of Frank Miller's work when you go see this movie. The movie has some great scenes and dialogue. Marv steals the movie, IMHO. Most of the movie is in black and white (as the comic). This is a beautiful movie to watch. It has a little Pulp Fiction feel to it as the stories intertwine (also, Bruce Willis is in the movie).The stories in the movie are all very gritty, violent and dark, mostly about people driven by revenge. A woman killed, a cop set up and jailed...not very hard to follow but made interesting by the way they tie together. All the acting here is well done and Frank Miller makes a cameo as a preist.

2,"Thoughtful Portrayal of Early 20th Century Rural Virginia: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day.

That's why it's amazing to see how much he didn't learn from the original Kong. In 1933, the producers and screenwriters worked very hard to eliminate anything from the script that proved superfluous or impeded the flow of the action. (That's the primary reason why the legendary ""spider sequence"" was removed from the original King Kong.) The tight pace of the action is what makes the original Kong so great.

His arguments, of course, are no longer useful to creationists, this book was written way before Darwin and Wallace structure their theory, but at his time this was a must read. Even Darwin and Wallace read the book lots of years later, when they were students, and this book imprint (at least as I'm concern) a great prejudice Darwin had to surpass to establish his theory. It is so well written, and, again, so well founded, that dismiss it was quite a task. Recently Dawkins wrote a book ""The blind Watchmaker"" that was inspired by Paley's ""Natural Theology"", and solidly refutes his arguments (irrefutable in Paley's time, since no scientific evidence or theory had been powerfully establish as to do so).

2,"you had to be there when it was released: ...to fully appreciate how revolutionary this record was. The advance press had everyone prepared for something out of the ordinary but Pepper was still a jaw dropper because it sounded so different from everything recorded before it. The biggest pop act in the biz ignored all conventions, including the love song, and ignored many recording and songwriting conventions in the bargain. As usual, the Beatles set the pace and everyone else worked like mad to catch up. The proof is in the songs, of course, and some people don't like the songs because the songs are generally about everyday experiences seen from new angles. Is this the greatest rock'n'roll record? To whom and who cares!

Track 2, ""Jive Talkin'"", is, as a matter of fact, a very well done cover of the BeeGee's classic disco hit.

Even then it was just stupid, a plane taking off gets hit by a mujahadine surface to air missile and then returns to its landing strip only to run into petrol drumms that lined the airstrip ! I mean really how lame. The fight sequence was poor, just all unrealistic situations. You can watch this once I guess, but then forget the 2 hours of your life you just wasted.

And there was this weird section at the end, where they try to pretend it was a true story, and they are having a meeting to discuss the historical facts about the book.

I'm highbrow, I mean, I can endure all kinds of dull things if there's lurking merit, but I couldn't endure this. The characters are flat.

I couldn't stand listening to this woman if she was sitting next to me in a restaurant or coffee shop and for the same reason I don't want to read a book from her point of view: She has nothing to say. So, zero points for content, maybe half a point for eloquence.

Youngblood contends that the events in the story are factual for the most part. But author Robin Moore is strangely silent. Moore never once claims that the book is non-fiction or is a biography. It is simply what Jack told him.The book reads like a teenage boy's fantasy, where Youngblood is a mixture between Han Solo and Indiana Jones, a rogue with a heart of gold. He can handle any gun and fly any plane. And all women love him, of course.Jack Youngblood is definitely a true character. But I believe that he is a bit prone to exaggaration.

Admiral Kirk is depicted as connivingly seizing command of the Enterprise, then incompetently commanding. Spock is shown with zero personality.

1,"Overrated: John Carpenter is usually regardede as one of the great directors of the genre, but I find him terribly overrated. In the seventies and early eighties he had a good grip on suspense, his movies were mostly amateurish, but inciting. Today one would expect him to be a professional, but he's still directing pure dilettantism, lacking the enthusiasm of his earlier work.Although Halloween is quite scary, in a somewhat childish but effective way, the ethichs are really the most terrifying thing about it, hilarious and monstrous at the same time: Teenagers, having fun in their parents beds, are butchered by a heavy-breathing retard wearing a Halloween-mask. Only the virtuous babysitting heroine survives this sexual-fascist Endlösung.

The increidible journey of 13 dwarves and one hobbit, which became the spark and foundation for the Lord of the Rings, is rich in detail that will only enhance your appreciation for these amazing stories.

1,"""Weird"" does not mean ""interesting"": I couldn't help but compare this movie to ""My One and Only"", George Hamilton's autobiographical movie about his adolescence. Both are stories of growing up weird, with mothers who are neurotic, to say the least.Unfortunately, having colorful characters does not a movie make. I think actually watching someone run with scissors would be more interesting than this movie.Critics have recommended Annette Bening for her tour de force--but a much better example is in the overlooked ""Julia"". Now there's something worth watching.To me, the problem is one of simple unpleasantness. (It's common in movies today that there's no real protagonist--no one to really sympathize with or care about at all.) About 40 minutes into this movie, I was hoping they'd all get carried off in straitjackets. Sadly, that does not happen.I suppose if you've had a really boring, empty life, you might find a story like this engaging.

It is also bizarre that I am the sole reviewer to point this out. Janey is only a 13 year old teenager. She is indeed rather mature for her age. Nonetheless, Janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her. Such an adult male (or female) is clearly breaking the law. Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined. The father is being played for a fool. This dysfunctional family seems doomed. Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection. Is she capable of handling this responsibility? Will matters finally get out of control? ""Rain"" is morally bankrupt.

1,"All books begin with a premise...: ... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future.

1,"Terrible: This book had been recommended to me, and it seemed like it would be good when I read the introduction, but after three times of starting and trying to finish this book, I decided it just wasn't worth it. It may have some events that are significant and add to the story with the sense that should go along with them, but somehow, this book bored me and seemed very flat and detached from any real feeling. When I was reading it, I couldn't feel the story and could not relate to Abbie, maybe because few of her feelings were aptly expressed in the story. The only thing I could really feel was the inevitable rushing of time and Abbie's fear of death,who snatches people away. It may be a good book to other people, especially those who can stand to finish it, but it just didn't keep my attention, and I can usually tolerate some slowness in a book.",terrible this book had been recommended to me and it seemed like it would be good when i read the introduction but after three times of starting and trying to finish this book i decided it just wasn t worth it it may have some events that are significant and add to the story with the sense that should go along with them but somehow this book bored me and seemed very flat and detached from any real feeling when i was reading it i couldn t feel the story and could not relate to abbie maybe because few of her feelings were aptly expressed in the story the only thing i could really feel was the inevitable rushing of time and abbie s fear of death who snatches people away it may be a good book to other people especially those who can stand to finish it but it just didn t keep my attention and i can usually tolerate some slowness in a book,1

2,"Just think about it!: Throughout my A1 language course, I have to read several books including world literature. The Stranger was one of them and when I finished reading the book I wondered what the propose or theme of this book was. A rational man telling a story in a very monotone way who seems to reject emotions and doesn't mind about anything? Is that what the whole book is about? Yes it is! Camus is trying to illustrate a character who doesn't intend to harm our society and in return is disowned and hated. The fact that Mersault always sticks to the truth is seen as something repulsive which make him different and simultaneously he is put into the category stranger. It is useless to search for the theme of the book for there are many.

1,"Good premise, but....: Based on the premise of this movie, I thought that I would enjoy it. But I found myself continuing to watch simply to find out how the movie ended. Although Gwyneth Paltrow received glowing reviews for this performance, and is doing what I'm sure is a wonderful acting job, the character she plays (Catherine) was so irritating to me that I found it difficult to watch. I didn't feel sympathy for her, as I should have, and I couldn't see how Hal could be attracted to her. Perhaps part of this was due to the mechanism of jumping back and forth in time--maybe I couldn't get a complete picture of who Catherine was. I only saw her as self-absorbed, foul-mouthed and ready to spurn any kindness offered her. She appeared to be more of an adolescent--in her behavior and her way of whining when she spoke--than a 27 year old. Also, I wanted more of the intrigue of those who have a passion for math, but that was missing in this film.",good premise but based on the premise of this movie i thought that i would enjoy it but i found myself continuing to watch simply to find out how the movie ended although gwyneth paltrow received glowing reviews for this performance and is doing what i m sure is a wonderful acting job the character she plays catherine was so irritating to me that i found it difficult to watch i didn t feel sympathy for her as i should have and i couldn t see how hal could be attracted to her perhaps part of this was due to the mechanism of jumping back and forth in time maybe i couldn t get a complete picture of who catherine was i only saw her as self absorbed foul mouthed and ready to spurn any kindness offered her she appeared to be more of an adolescent in her behavior and her way of whining when she spoke than a 27 year old also i wanted more of the intrigue of those who have a passion for math but that was missing in this film,1

While the book seems on the surface to be a typical Kinsey Millhone story, Sue Grafton writes this book in peril. She tells a solid story about Kinsey being hired by a doctor's ex-wife, recommended to her by a long-ago client to find a missing person, the prominent doctor who has vanished without a trace. The story also involves a potentially dangerous near-romance for Kinsey, but Ms. Grafton's greatest risk of peril comes with her final plot twist.

I tried placing it further away but the burn slowly built up as long as the lamp was turned on near by. Once I made this connection I immediately unplugged it and started using my old regular lamp and what do ya know, no more burning skin. It's a shame because I really liked the quality of the light, kind of like sun light. Unfortunately it seems to carry similar radiation properties because the skin burn from the lamp feels just like a skin burn from the sun.

2,"A Mick-heavy, great Stones album: This is almost a Mick Jagger album grafted into a Stones album, bringing out the best in the former and plenty of solid work from the latter. Jagger not only co-writes the songs and sings, as usual, but also plays guitars (including slide), bass, harmonica, keyboards, percussion, sometimes all on one track. I haven't seen this much one-man work performed so beautifully on a pop album since Prince was at his peak.

1,"An Unusual Twist on Cinematic Time Travel That Doesn't Seem to Understand Itself: An odd twist on time distortion in which, due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over Queens, a New York cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long-dead father thirty years in the past. Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories. Hackneyed, hammy and haphazard, it plays like a bloated sci-fi short story in desperate need of revision.",an unusual twist on cinematic time travel that doesn t seem to understand itself an odd twist on time distortion in which due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over queens a new york cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long dead father thirty years in the past completely ignoring the warnings of doc brown and marty mcfly he immediately spoils the upcoming world series and dozens of important life moments for his father before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders the film can t decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path and its main plot mechanism is clunky under explained and inconsistent it s also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father son baseball allegories hackneyed hammy and haphazard it plays like a bloated sci fi short story in desperate need of revision,1

IF the movie were going for $4.99 I'd consider sending it to my cousin as a joke who loves zombie movies. But these weren't even zombies, they had grey makeup and looked kind of like the guys from V, the old movie/TV Show, but they didn't even have scales! It was just grey makeup! Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, away from this film! Cooking with Porn stars was a better buy than this would be, and that movie was REALLY bad.

2,"The Getaway...: ... is one of the most exciting cues I've heard in a long time. Alan Silvestri composed an atmospheric score with some great Hitchcock feel to it. The first half of the CD is pure haunting music you could compare with Jerry Goldsmith's ""The Haunting"" and one should listen to it with headphones. But the last three tracks are the reason I bought this CD. ""the Getaway"" and ""Reunion"" is very ""Psycho"" and ""Cape Fear"" sounding. The brass section plays a question-answer thing with the strings.

Akira Kurosawa was a master of his craft, and nowhere is it more evident than in this 1956 masterpiece. It's no wonder Hollywood remade this into a western in The Magnificent Seven. The story is superb, gathering a rag-tag team of ronin together to protect a helpless village from brigands. The visuals are phenominal, even considering the period in which it was produced, and the sound is great. One slight downside to this DVD is that it only comes with a mono Japanese soundtrack, so you'll have to read subtitles for three hours, but trust me, it's well worth it.",the greastest samurai film of all time for anyone who is interested in samurai epics or for those who are just looking for a enthralling story seven samurai is just what you need akira kurosawa was a master of his craft and nowhere is it more evident than in this 1956 masterpiece it s no wonder hollywood remade this into a western in the magnificent seven the story is superb gathering a rag tag team of ronin together to protect a helpless village from brigands the visuals are phenominal even considering the period in which it was produced and the sound is great one slight downside to this dvd is that it only comes with a mono japanese soundtrack so you ll have to read subtitles for three hours but trust me it s well worth it,2

2,"Classic Mystery: Peter Wimsey solves a classic locked-room mystery, as he tries to determine how the corpse of an elderly man came to be in the Bellona Club on Remembrance Day. The man died sometime after 10am, but the exact time of death is a mystery. It becomes a pressing mystery when it becomes clear that the time of death determines who will inherit a large fortune. The convoluted family argument and complex relationships make Wimsey's efforts more difficult. Halfway through the book the culprit seems to be apprehended, but Wimsey isn't so sure. I liked the model of a solution partway through the book that had to be unraveled.This book had little engagement with Wimsey's life outside of the mystery. It is a book dependent upon Wimsey entering an existing situation. The details are numerous, and we get an interesting look at a London gentlemen's club in the 1920s.

I just don't understand why Bon Jovi has remaind so popular while other bands like Dokken and Ratt have not enjoyed that level of success. Was Bon Jovi that much different than Ratt or Dokken? Of course not! Those three bands first appeared during the '80s and pretty much recorded the same kind of music (hard rock). Although this album does contain some of Bon Jovi's best tunes (Wanted Dead or Alive and You Give Love a Bad Name) those songs are really no better than Dokken's In My Dreams or Ratt's Round and Round.

Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close.

2,"As good as it gets: This, along with yellow brick road, is certainly the best ej album. Every single song on it is a masterpiece, superb musicianship, arrangements, and singing. Admittedly, it's not extremely varied in terms of production and style, most of the songs are ballads and otherwise slow-tempo songs, quivering with strings sounding like one of Mozart's Requiems, in other words a very dark feel (like the moody blues' To Our Children's Children's Children). Along with tunes that have become standards, like ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""Levon"", there is beautiful acoustic picking (Holiday Inn), melodrama (Indian Sunset), beatlesque brilliance (Razorface, All the Nasties). If you like albums that must be enjoyed in their entirity (like dark side of the moon, wind and wuthering, crime of the century) you'll like it. If you like albums where every song is different (sheer heart attack, peter gabriel #1) you'll probably find it a bit relentlessly dreary and spooky.

1,"Nice light - made poorly: This light is nice, but it is not made very well. The pole that it hangs from did not screw in straight. You don't realize this (it looked fine on the ground), until you get it hung. It was a slight angle, but any angle of a light hanging down is not pretty. No way to fix this as it appears the threading was off. When taking this down to return, it is next to impossible to unscrew the post to repackage without ruining the pole. Also, the plate that goes up by the ceiling is very hard to get on and this is what holds the light up. It screws in on two sides which doesn't give much room between the ceiling and where you need to hold the screw driver.

2,"A deep book: The Heart is a lonely Hunter is a very different sort of book. I've read quite a few books, and never one quite like it. One person I know compared it to the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath because of the dark story line. The story is based upon the lives of 5 main characters, the majority of the story telling spent on the mute John Singer and the teenager Mick Kelly. Themes of alienation, isolation, intolerance, loneliness, and the fulfillment of dreams dominate the novel. The opposite of a superficial book, this story is about how people feel at their core and their dreams and aspirations. The writing is good, but just not very happy. The focus is more on how lonely each character feels and for what reasons. After reading it, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter forced me to think deeply.

1,"False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the story.: Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't.

But his lyrics carry each one with often times devastating results (in a good way).

Not only that, but the story is rather unoriginal as well. If you have ever read ""The Last Vampire"" by Christopher Pike, then you will see that the relationship between Jessica and Aubrey is very similar to that of Sita and Seymour (Seymour also writes true stories about vampires).

Although it was thought provoking, and at times you really felt for the characters, it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter.",am i the only one who didnt like this i just finished reading lord of the flies in my gr 11 english class and i wish that this book was not required to be read in school because i do not recommend it although it was thought provoking and at times you really felt for the characters it was too grim a look at mankind i entirely disagree with golding s idea of mankind being inherently evil and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe this was fairly well written but i have read books that challenged my intelligence more it is obvious that golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it i felt that it was borderline propaganda and i actually regret that i have read it but i didn t have much choice in the matter,1

Michael Myers, whose relentless earnestness made the first two films horror classics, is conspicuously absent, instead replaced by a ridiculous premise about children being converted into monsters by wearing ""Silver Shamrock"" Halloween masks. The final twenty minutes or so of the film inundate the viewer with a thoroughly annoying, synthesized jingle for the Silver Shamrock company that is memorable because it is some of the most pathetically cheesy music ever to be captured on celluloid. The only things that are scary about this movie are that John Carpenter put his name on it and a movie company actually mass marketed it.

1,"Overrated, dull, and unpleasant.: I saw this movie in my film studies class. At first I thought, ""Boxing movie? Cool!"" but only a few minutes into the film I discovered that it was miles away from exciting. Jake La Motta is an extremely unsympathetic character whose temper and jealousy don't give any motivation for the audience to like him. He alienates everyone close to him and I couldn't bring myself to feel sorry for his eventual fate. Robert De Niro's portrayal of La Motta was well done, but being well-acted doesn't make the film any more watchable. The boxing scenes were the parts I was most looking forward to, but again, I was sorely disappointed. I am well aware that the boxing wasn't the main focus of this film, but a director of Scorsese's caliber should have been able to make it slightly interesting.The only thing that angers me more than the fact that my time was wasted by this film is the fact that so many hail it as a masterpiece.",overrated dull and unpleasant i saw this movie in my film studies class at first i thought boxing movie cool but only a few minutes into the film i discovered that it was miles away from exciting jake la motta is an extremely unsympathetic character whose temper and jealousy don t give any motivation for the audience to like him he alienates everyone close to him and i couldn t bring myself to feel sorry for his eventual fate robert de niro s portrayal of la motta was well done but being well acted doesn t make the film any more watchable the boxing scenes were the parts i was most looking forward to but again i was sorely disappointed i am well aware that the boxing wasn t the main focus of this film but a director of scorsese s caliber should have been able to make it slightly interesting the only thing that angers me more than the fact that my time was wasted by this film is the fact that so many hail it as a masterpiece,1

I didn't expect it to do well, thinking that it would probably only be ballads, but then I heard her perform ""Miss Independent"" on this season's American Idol, and I was glad. That song seemed the type that would be a radio and Billboard hit. However, I was a little disappointed that the song sounded too much like Christina Aguilera, and that Kelly didn't have her own style. I bought the CD today, and I am impressed. ""Miss Indepedent"" is not representative of the rest of the album. There were a few tracks that were a little too bland for me, but on the average the tracks were good and refreshing.

Afterall, we have fairly similar taste in books.After forcing myself to get through the first 100 pages, hoping it would get better, I just had to stop. This book was hands-down, the LEAST funny book I have ever read in my entire life. Eventually, trying to actually read it and not skim became completely impossible.The story jumps from location to location so much that I wondered what was even going on and why the author chose to throw in the ""bar"" location.

It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read.",i loved this book this story of a cantonese family in hong kong is filled with warmth and humor it tracks the relationship between wallace a clever young man of portuguese cantonese descent and the family s shrewd miserly tyrannical patriarch perhaps it s a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end but mo writes so well about families and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other that it doesn t matter the scenes between wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife may ling and between wallace and his beloved nephews are simply a joy to read,2

Each of this movie's stories are so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash.

2,"Good, but not the best.: Nothing about this La Traviata was bad. Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.",good but not the best nothing about this la traviata was bad many things were even quite good i was particularly pleased that they kept alfredo s father s second aria which is usually cut out but there were more that were simply unremarkable if this was the only video of la traviata available i would be well pleased with it it is satisfactory and on stage it was probably excellent the only thing about it that really bothered me was that alfredo his father and violetta all looked about the same age and that would not i think have been apparent from the audience however there are several versions that are considerably better this version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera but if you wish to see only one let it be a different one there are three that i think are equally good the version with placido domingo and theresa stratas the version with anna moffo though it has no subtitles and a fairly new version with jose cura,2

2,"Film Noir Classic and an Edgar G. Ulmer Masterpiece: Detour is one of the all-time great examples of film noir. The use of shadowy black and white cinematography, a star-crossed protagonist, a femme fatale, a cynical voice-over narration and ambiguous morality can almost be used to define the Film Noir Genre. Brought together by legendary director Edgar G. Ulmer in only a few days and on a diminutive budget, Detour's B-Film sets only add to both the film and the genre, a true testament to the mastery of Ulmer.Al Roberts (Tom Neal) makes a series of bad choices that bring him to a very low point in his life. Vera (Ann Savage) plays the quintessential Bad Girl. Their witty repartee and in truth, much of the dialogue throughout is a main attraction of this film. The plot is revealed in flashbacks and continues on uncompromisingly to the conclusion. The characterizations, dialogue, plot and photography all contribute to make this taut, gritty film a must for film noir enthusiasts.",film noir classic and an edgar g ulmer masterpiece detour is one of the all time great examples of film noir the use of shadowy black and white cinematography a star crossed protagonist a femme fatale a cynical voice over narration and ambiguous morality can almost be used to define the film noir genre brought together by legendary director edgar g ulmer in only a few days and on a diminutive budget detour s b film sets only add to both the film and the genre a true testament to the mastery of ulmer al roberts tom neal makes a series of bad choices that bring him to a very low point in his life vera ann savage plays the quintessential bad girl their witty repartee and in truth much of the dialogue throughout is a main attraction of this film the plot is revealed in flashbacks and continues on uncompromisingly to the conclusion the characterizations dialogue plot and photography all contribute to make this taut gritty film a must for film noir enthusiasts,2

1,"Very disappointing: I have been a fan of Ms. Block since Weetzie Bat, and I anxiously await the arrival of any new book. Unfortunately, IWATF was a huge disappointment. Her choice to give her main character the painfully obvious name of ""Barbie"" seemed like a slap in the face. How unoriginal. And the name of the book itself was irksome, a goofy title where magic could have been made. On the whole, I found no truly loveable characters and felt everyone was too spoiled to care about. Violet and Claire continued the trend, and now I hope upon hope that her next book will return to the punk rock slink-chunk charm of Weetzie Bat or the lyrical mystery of The Hanged Man or the inspiring magic of Girl Goddess.

2,"This is a fantastic value: What a great little item. I have a ten year old vehicle that has nice speakers, but only a cassette/radio combo. This pops into the cassette player and the little cord hangs out the front to attach to the iPod. Works great and I can adjust the sound either from the iPod, the cassette, or both. I was a little concerned at first, because it would pop itself out the first couple of times I tried to use it.

The plot centers around the death and imminent funeral of the village matriarch, seen through the eyes, experience, and relationships of shopkeeper Lucy. Chapters are fairly brief and somewhat interconnected but stand-alone as studies of the way women (often, though occasionally the men are featured) deal with the daily struggles of relationships, making a living, and hopefulness in an unforgiving environment. In some ways it's a 'feel good' book, in that some of the lives/relationships turn toward hope realized. Yet these are stories which unflinchingly, yet with masterful nuance, describe the fallibilities of flawed people.

It is accepted that Beaton's mysteries are somewhat short on ""mystery"" leaving her hopefully endearing characters to carry the interest in the narratives. As a result, it is harder to accept that after eleven installments, Agatha has not grown as a character nor as an amateur sleuth. In this latest novel, ""Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell,"" Agatha has been stripped of whatever comedic touches she initially possessed. In the place of a gentle wryness about herself has mushroomed a seething hair-trigger temper that leads her to awkward outbursts, making her a very unsympathetic heroine.

You've got all these famous people from history, and you don't try to see how they'd spark off each other, or how they'd genuninely react to 'our' world.

1,"Good, But Undeserving Of Its Status: Actually two and a half stars. America has, unfortunately, produced fewer true ""fairy tales"" than Europe. And though Americans could enjoy the old stories, simple and universal as they are, we needed new ones with the distinctive qualities of our land. ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", American tall tales, and the comic book creations of the 1950s and 60s are what we have produced to fill the gap. When I first read this book at 7 years old, I was disappointed it was so different from the movie, which I loved then, but as I've grown older I've found the book to be superior, because it depicts Oz as less of a benign candyland. Despite this the book (and its sequels even more so) is seriously flawed. These are flaws of imagination: like the works of Roal Dahl many of the people who read the Oz books see them as unbridedly imaginative. They arent. C.S. Lewis built a cousin-world to Oz with much more imagination and style in his far better Narnia books.

The ""Black Robes"" were trying to convert the 'savages' to find paradise to which they did not seek, they had their own religion and their own paradise to look forward to, where their loved ones would be. The black robes were also their to help the French colonize the area, making it safe for others to come over if they all had found the same religion, they could be safe. The Movie showed how the Indians tried to syncronize catholicism with their own culture and how the Black Robe had gained an insight to their understanding and had compassion for them, with a love for them without trying to exploit them as ignorant savages.

2,"Sensational: I loved the story of ""Lottie"" and Hayden. It read differently than most of the romances out today, as it had a bit of a twist to the story with a surprise ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it too quickly, because I was sad when it was over. It didn't take forever for this couple to realize they were in love but there was a huge obstacle in the way that held them back. The book involves children and the author did an excellent job with their personalities. So many books have children four years old talking like a high school student. The dialog that came from the children fit their ages.

So with that in mind, I had high hopes for ""Eight Crazy Nights"". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces.

1,"It really had potential, but....: Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be ""the modern Story of O"". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O.",it really had potential but although i am an avid anne rice fan i initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be the modern story of o since story of o is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica i just had to buy it but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true the book starts out strong with intensely erotic scenes focusing on lisa and eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic by the time i finished it i felt extremely unsatisfied if you re an anne rice fan this is a good book to read if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror but overall there s much better erotica out there and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the story of o,1

2,"Great purchase for the price!: I rated 5 stars because it fulfills my need at an affordable price... I'm using it to store my airsoft pistols. It's very roomy (maybe a little too much space, because things do move around a bit when carried). Currently it's about full having 3 guns and 6 mags in there: mac10 (1 mag), 1911 (3 mags), and m9 (2 mags). I'm not so sure it would hold up to heavy duty abuse or real firearms as they are heavier.This leads me to my only complaint. For all Plano cases in general, make the foam a bit denser because heavier, skinnier guns (including accessories such as magazines) will slide around during transport and bang against each other.Overall, well worth the price... if you're looking for something heavier duty, you gotta shell out more money though.",great purchase for the price i rated 5 stars because it fulfills my need at an affordable price i m using it to store my airsoft pistols it s very roomy maybe a little too much space because things do move around a bit when carried currently it s about full having 3 guns and 6 mags in there mac10 1 mag 1911 3 mags and m9 2 mags i m not so sure it would hold up to heavy duty abuse or real firearms as they are heavier this leads me to my only complaint for all plano cases in general make the foam a bit denser because heavier skinnier guns including accessories such as magazines will slide around during transport and bang against each other overall well worth the price if you re looking for something heavier duty you gotta shell out more money though,2

Take out all the mindless erotica (that I skip anyway and always have), and about half of the flora and fauna descriptions, and every single recitation of the poem, and you will have a 100 page book to segway on to book number 6.

Apparently, the Alex Cross saga is his most affortunated serie. However, the book (in Spanish El lobo de Siberia) is full of clichés and resources recommended for apprentice writers only. Using the simile between one of the victims and Claudia Shiffer to give an idea of the character is over used. Same thing happens with the nick name of Dragons' killer to give us the image of Cross for the FBI people. Cross does not have a failure in any role of his life, this is unbelivable.

I have always supported the notion that the best way to make money is to sell a quality product. Universal doesn't seem to agree. The disc starts off with 5 minutes of forced advertising (some marketing 'genius' at Universal deserves to lose a job over that idea). The special features are the poorest I have ever seen for a special edition and include a 'making of' that is a downright lie; 5 minutes of computer graphics about how they made the animals seem to speak.

His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours.

It also presents the deep friendship and comradery of the Round Table, as well as the anguish of her childless-ness.

2,"Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome: Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (""A Year in Provence,"" anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome.

Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary. However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves. He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation. If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's ""The Good War.""

This one is superior in several ways. First, the sound quality is amazing! There is no claim that the tracks have been remastered, but they sure sound like it. Second, I believe the track selection is better. The album contains the best tracks from the ""Sound of Money"" album, (most of them), plus some older Eddie Money material as well a couple of tracks from the ""Right Here"" album. The result is basically, the ""Sound of Money"" album, updated and improved. Interestingly, this album is made in England and appears to be an import.

1,"This time the stereotypes are a lot closer to the truth: In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness. The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light. I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art. But from the point of view that is most interesting to me, as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities, I disagree that something very good can be built on such things.",this time the stereotypes are a lot closer to the truth in my experience and i wish it were not so gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity cliquishness and lewdness the book s chief merit is that it doesn t deny their existence but its chief defect is that it attempts largely unsuccessfully to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light i agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable for example i agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities at least given a certain understanding of art but from the point of view that is most interesting to me as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities i disagree that something very good can be built on such things,1

It teaches all the letter sounds with a catchy song. Children like it and learn their letter sounds from it.

IMO, the zipper needs not to be all around, just having it on the top should be fine. 2) The plastic bits on one of the compressor cords disintegrated within a week, so I had to tie the cord itself into a knot.",this is a review of the targus rg0322 matrix backpack this is the only backpack from the targus extensive product list that i found worthy as a successor to my previous targus cddb1 backpack probably due to the lighting this product doesn t look very black as pictured but it really is fairly dark a definite plus in my books there s ample room for my widescreen 15 macbook pro the flaws are minor 1 the zipper of the pen holder compartment has a habit of coming apart so don t put anything you don t want to lose in there imo the zipper needs not to be all around just having it on the top should be fine 2 the plastic bits on one of the compressor cords disintegrated within a week so i had to tie the cord itself into a knot,2

The concert was recorded in Koln, Germany sometime after the release of ""A Night on the Town"". The majority of the songs are taken from that recording. Koln, of course, was the setting for a famous Keith Jarrett release on ECM. Horsnby dedicates ""Another Day"" to Leon Russell.

1,"Dark and drab DVD!: What a disappointment! This DVD must be a real low for Paramount Home Video! Not only is the image far too dark, but the colors are so horribly weak and cold. I took out the latest Laser Disc version from my shelf and immediately saw much warmer and richer hues all through the film! And a lighter image with better contrasts! Of course, the DVD looks quite a lot sharper with less chroma noise on all those red Santa outfits, and I love the added participation of Ms. Clooney. But the only thing that looks great colorwise on the DVD, is the green ivy on the credits. Come on Paramount - almost ten years have passed since the release of the Laser. This 1991 Disc was far from perfect, so what's the point of making the DVD appear decidedly worse? Is this technical progress? Paramount should recall the DVD quickly and check out the original negative in their vaults, or at least create a new transfer from the same source as the Laser Disc.

1,"Yoga For Sufers Review: As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver.

1,"Think twice about buying this player !: I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights.

With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so.

In Clockwork, he focuses on Alex, a young man with an obsession for Beethoven who gets thrown in the slammer for murder. Instead of spending his life behind bars, he volunteers himself for an experimental cure. But, as a resulf of this cure, he is robbed of his free willand thrown into a cruel futuristic British society with no way of defending himself.

1,"Not the best way to start a trend...: I did not like this film. In fact, I found it to be one of the worst of the famed slashers. It was not at all scary, nor did it have many creative kills (there was one, in particular, that I did like though). I guess at its time, just people getting murdered was scary enough, but not in today's world. Also, Michael Myers is not supernatural, so why does he not die? He just keeps coming back to a point of redundancy. Its just dumb and predictably pointless.

Shamanism is a method for obtaining spiritual insights that are non-linear in nature. It is creative. It is challenging. For me this book attempts to structure shamanism psychologically, and that is not what the shamanic pathway is about, it limits the potential of the Work. To the seasoned journeyier this is not the book to read.If you are a psychologist who wants to expand your practice by ""doing"" shamanism without doing your own personal work so you can make more money- please take another path.

2,"Perry is now two times as classy!: William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon",perry is now two times as classy william monk awakens in a victorian era london hospital with amnesia over the course of this book he returns to his job as a policeman hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills what s fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime over the course of perry s new series this book being the debut monk s past will at various times haunt delight and maybe even endanger him and the people who come to be his allies don t always like him but their loyalties to one another shine through as with the pitt mysteries anne perry s trademark detail and eye opening descriptions of what victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon,2

No One Here Gets Out Alive, you have noticed they did not show the artist side of him as he was in real life. They show more of the depression and self destruction.

They fit well, especially around the outside of the thigh, where leakage is most likely to occur.

1,"Where's the story?: ""Arthur C. Clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time,"" says the publisher's blurb. By who? _3001_ contains maybe 25 pages' worth of story (though ""story"" is putting it too strongly), padded out to ten times that length by self-indulgent prophesying and preaching, in amateurish prose that makes you cringe several times per page. And when, after 150 pages of this padding, we finally get to the actual story, Clarke fails to provide us with the most important and potentially interesting part of it, the actual message whose warning of impending disaster finally sets the real plot in motion. Ironically, the best writing and reading come in the nonfictional source notes and valediction at the end of the book. For addicts only, and they might want to wait for the cheaper paperback edition, which surely won't be long in coming",where s the story arthur c clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time says the publisher s blurb by who 3001 contains maybe 25 pages worth of story though story is putting it too strongly padded out to ten times that length by self indulgent prophesying and preaching in amateurish prose that makes you cringe several times per page and when after 150 pages of this padding we finally get to the actual story clarke fails to provide us with the most important and potentially interesting part of it the actual message whose warning of impending disaster finally sets the real plot in motion ironically the best writing and reading come in the nonfictional source notes and valediction at the end of the book for addicts only and they might want to wait for the cheaper paperback edition which surely won t be long in coming,1
2,"An engaging historical drama... Chaaaaaaaaaaarge!!!: A prideful vendetta between bullying English Lord Cardigan and a talented but hot-tempered junior officer is set against the disasterous British rout at the hands of Russia during the Crimean War. I can't speak to the supposed historical innaccuracies of this Tony Richardson film, since most of what I know about the infamous Charge I've learned from either Tennyson's rah-rah romantic poem, or Douglas Frasier's sardonic Flashman novels (with which it shares a certain mordant, antiauthoritarian darkness), but I did find it pretty entertaining and well-produced. It's also quite similar to Peter Wier's ""Gallipoli,"" although this is more bluntly class-conscious and hysterical in tone. Richard William's animated sequences, used in the titles and interludes, are wry spinoffs of Gilded Age cartoons, and prefigure Terry Gilliam's animation in the ""Monty Python"" series.

In later chapters, Greek quotes from the New Testament are used in the exercises.One of the problems with this book is that some of the exercises refer you to the Greek New Testament (GNT) which means you'll have to buy a GNT to complete those exercises.

I fixed it myself because I didn't want to return it, by bending it back into shape (it's sort of flimsy, so it wasn't hard). But, it's too loud for the bedroom even on low. And, it smells of an oil/electrical smell when it is turned on, yuck. I have it turned on outside to try to work out the smell (no, it's not rubbing or smoking or anything).I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use. The Holmes was extremely quiet on low, and had the added benefit of a rotatable angled vent that could blow diagonally from the window into the room at the side.

2,"Great Movie!: Let's get this straight right now. I only gave it 4 stars because giving it 5 stars would mean that it was up there with the reigning king of all gangster movies, Scarface (1983). With that out of the way, let me say that this is one of the most underappreciated films of the 90's. Commercially unsuccessful, this should have gotten much more praise and location in '93 when it was first introduced. It's a movie about a kid who's torn between his loving father and the most respected hood in the neighborhood, Sonny. Sounds pretty simple, but De Niro told this Bronx Tale with mastery and precision. I really hope De Niro considers directing more films in the near or distant future, cause like i said, he did a helluva job with this one.",great movie let s get this straight right now i only gave it 4 stars because giving it 5 stars would mean that it was up there with the reigning king of all gangster movies scarface 1983 with that out of the way let me say that this is one of the most underappreciated films of the 90 s commercially unsuccessful this should have gotten much more praise and location in 93 when it was first introduced it s a movie about a kid who s torn between his loving father and the most respected hood in the neighborhood sonny sounds pretty simple but de niro told this bronx tale with mastery and precision i really hope de niro considers directing more films in the near or distant future cause like i said he did a helluva job with this one,2

2,Useful extras: I already have a 'Complete Works of Shakespeare' on Kindle. The advantage of this edition (apart from the fact that it is cheap) is all the 'extras' It has those hard-to-get 'apocryphal' plays which I happen to have a reason to study. For me this alone makes it a good deal. But the other extras are useful too particularly the commentaries by Johnson and Hazlitt. Modern Shakespeare scholars often refer to these works and it convenient to have them ready-to hand on my Kindle. It is easy to navigate using the TOC (which is where some Kindle editions fall down on the job). So all in all I rate it as excellent.,useful extras i already have a complete works of shakespeare on kindle the advantage of this edition apart from the fact that it is cheap is all the extras it has those hard to get apocryphal plays which i happen to have a reason to study for me this alone makes it a good deal but the other extras are useful too particularly the commentaries by johnson and hazlitt modern shakespeare scholars often refer to these works and it convenient to have them ready to hand on my kindle it is easy to navigate using the toc which is where some kindle editions fall down on the job so all in all i rate it as excellent,2

The writer does a quality job of presenting history through fiction and creating real-life characters in such a short book. While reading, you feel like you are there in the action. I have only a few minor issues with the book as it gets some of the history wrong. For example, it describes Founding Father Samuel Adams as an atheist--he was actually a believing Christian.

The only thing that's annoying with wireless routers in general (I've worked with 2 so I know I'm not an expert on this but I've tried to find the solution on other brands websites) is that there doesn't seem to be simple plug and play action but rather you need to renew the ip which is really easy on windows but I haven't figured out how to do it on my mac since I previously had no need to do so.

1,"Disappointing: I am a great fan of Griffin. I've read every one of his books, many of them twice or more. I been concerned that he's getting old and the supply will stop. Apparently, he's addressed this issue by bringing in the kid. Unfortunately, the kid can't write. While emulating the old man's style, the story is boring, incomplete, and tedious. There really is no story. An excellent first chapter is never wrapped properly. We spend the whole book setting up our hero to go into action on Cypress, except it never happens.

2,"Here's the skinny on this release: Four stars for the creative band, KISS, and for these strong, early records. This box is new from Universal and includes the first three CDs, ""Kiss,"" ""Hotter Than Hell"" and ""Dressed To Kill."" The actual discs are dated ""1997,"" so they are probably the original remasters, and not new remasters, I am guessing. The box includes the three CD covers of the orignal three CDs, but no additional artwork or liner notes. Although some might prefer the 1980s work and beyond, KISS' strong period will always be the 1970s, and their pre""Alive"" recordings are found here.",here s the skinny on this release four stars for the creative band kiss and for these strong early records this box is new from universal and includes the first three cds kiss hotter than hell and dressed to kill the actual discs are dated 1997 so they are probably the original remasters and not new remasters i am guessing the box includes the three cd covers of the orignal three cds but no additional artwork or liner notes although some might prefer the 1980s work and beyond kiss strong period will always be the 1970s and their pre alive recordings are found here,2
